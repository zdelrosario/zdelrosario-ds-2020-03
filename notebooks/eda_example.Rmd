# Diamonds
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Let's demonstrate what EDA "looks like" by way of example. This is me investigating the `diamonds` dataset.

## Background
<!-- ------------------------------- -->

Dataset of [diamonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_(gemstone))

The 4 C's are used to judge a diamond's quality (and therefore its value):

[carat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carat_(mass)), a unit of mass [`1 ct = 200 mg`]
- *Larger is better*

[clarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_clarity), a rating of internal and surface blemishes
- *Clearer is better*

![clarity](~/src/Diamond-Clarity.jpg)

[color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_color), caused by impurities
- *Clear tends to be more desirable*

[cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_cut), the style and quality of the diamond's geometric shape
- *Ideal is best!*

## Initial look
<!-- ------------------------------- -->

```{r}
diamonds %>% glimpse()
```

**Observations**:

- I'm interested in the "4 C's" and diamond price:
  - `carat`, in `ct`
  - `cut`, a factor
  - `color`, a factor
  - `clarity`, a factor
  - `price`, in USD

```{r}
diamonds %>% select(carat, cut, color, clarity, price) %>% summary()
```

**Observations**:

- `carat` runs from about 0.2 to 5; larger is better.
- `cut` runs from `Fair` to `Ideal`, in ascending order.
- `color` runs from `D` to `J`; `D` is clear and higher letters indicate a greater presence of yellow. Clear (`D`) is [more desirable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_color).
- `clarity` runs from `I1` (included) to `IF` (internally flawless); this is the [modern GIA scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_clarity#Modern_GIA_grading_system)
- `price` runs from $326 to $18,823.

## 1d EDA
<!-- ------------------------------- -->

```{r, fig.width=6}
diamonds %>%

  ggplot(aes(price)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 120)
```

**Observations**:

- Large peak in prices around `$1000`
- Smaller, broader peak in prices around `$4000`
- Long asymmetric tail stretching up to ~`$18,000`

### Deeper look
<!-- ------------------------------- -->

```{r, fig.width=6}
diamonds %>%
  filter(price < 2000) %>%

  ggplot(aes(price)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100)
```

**Observations**:

- The peak seems to be closer to `$750` than `$1000`
- There's an *odd gap* in prices near `$1,500`....
- There are strange "fingers": Prices seemingly clustered near special values.

**END**

## Bonus

This is the figure that will be in each team's Google Doc:

```{r, fig.width=6}
diamonds %>%

  ggplot(aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1 / 4, size = 1) +
  ## geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +

  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Carat",
    y = "Price ($)"
  )
## ggsave("../images/eda_example.png")
```
